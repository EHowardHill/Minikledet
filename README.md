# Minikledet

Minikledet is a Hebrew IME written in Python 3.

I became tired with my exclusive proficiency in English typing on American keyboards, so I decided to write this tool in an hour instead of learning how to type Hebrew on American keyboards.

You type in the box below, and it replaces your Latin characters with (roughly) the phonetically corresponding Hebrew characters. You can also type using the buttons above, but if you don't know what key corresponds to what character, the tooltip of the buttons above should give you a clue.

Check out `Minikledet.exe` to play around with it!
