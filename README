# Minikledet

Minikledet is a Hebrew IME written in Python 3.

In short, I became tired with my exclusive proficiency in English typing on American keyboards, so I decided to write this tool in an hour instead of learning how to type Hebrew on American keyboards.

Check out `Minikledet.exe` to play around with it!
